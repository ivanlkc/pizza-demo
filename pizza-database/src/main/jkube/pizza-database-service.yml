# This file is required for the JKube maven plugin to properly configure the ClusterIP for the H2 TCP database connection.
# The JKube plugin will only detect "server.port" used by tomcat.
# Therefore this file will override that behaviour and assign the proper ClusterIP for H2 TCP JDBC connections.

  ports:
  - name: tcp-database
    port: @pizza.database.tcp-port@
    protocol: TCP
